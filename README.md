Hello!

Algorithmic programming for triangulating a polygon, the Triangulate Monotone Polygon algorithm, is one of my projects in the Computational Geometry course of my Master's degree.

# Convex Hull Visualization

This project provides a visualization tool for computing and displaying the convex hull of a set of 2D points. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that can enclose all the given points.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib
- numpy
- tkinter

## Usage

1. Install the necessary Python libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib numpy
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python convex_hull.py
    ```

3. Select the input text file containing the coordinates of the points when prompted. The file should contain points in the following format:

    ```
    x1 y1
    x2 y2
    ...
    xn yn
    ```

4. The script will display the points and the convex hull in a plot.

## Conclusion

This script provides a simple yet effective way to visualize the convex hull of a set of 2D points. It demonstrates basic concepts of computational geometry and can be extended or modified for more advanced applications.
